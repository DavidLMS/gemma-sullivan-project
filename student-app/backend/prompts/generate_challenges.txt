PREVIOUS CHALLENGES (to avoid repetition):
{previous_challenges}

CHALLENGE REQUIREMENTS:
Create exactly 5 experimental challenges IN {language} that:

1. **Use basic materials**: Paper, cardboard, pencils, colors, rulers, household items, natural materials
2. **No internet required**: All activities can be done offline with basic resources
3. **Deliverable outputs**: Results can be submitted via:
   - Text descriptions
   - Hand drawings/sketches  
   - Photographs of physical creations
   - Simple measurements or observations

4. **Age-appropriate**: Suitable for a {student_age}-year-old student in {student_course}
5. **Engaging**: Connect to {student_interests} when possible to maintain motivation
6. **Educational value**: Each challenge should help reinforce understanding of the content
7. **Experimental nature**: Include observation, measurement, creation, or testing elements
8. **Safety-conscious**: Only use safe, accessible materials

CHALLENGE DESIGN PRINCIPLES:
- **Hands-on experimentation**: Students should create, build, measure, observe, or test something
- **Real-world application**: Show how the educational content applies in practical situations
- **Creative expression**: Allow for personal interpretation and creativity
- **Problem-solving**: Include challenges that require thinking and adaptation
- **Documentation**: Students can record their process and results

If content sources include multiple subjects, create INTERDISCIPLINARY challenges that combine concepts from different areas in creative ways.
